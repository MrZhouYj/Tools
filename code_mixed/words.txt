Suburbs and country areas are， in many ways， even more vulnerable than well-patroled urban streets。 Statistics show the crime rate rising more dramatically in those allegedly tranquil areas than in cities。 At any rate， the era of leaving the front door on the latch is over。
It has been replaced by dead-bolt locks， security chains， electronic alarm systems and trip wires hooked up to a police station or private guard firm。 Many suburban families have sliding glass doors on their patios， with steel bars elegantly built in so no one can pry the doors open。
 It is not uncommon， in the most pleasant of homes， to see pasted on the windows small notices announcing that the premises are under surveillance by this security force or that guard company
 The lock is the new symbol of America。 Indeed， a recent public-service advertisement by a large insurance company featured not charts showing how much at risk we are， but a picture of a child's bicycle with the now-usual padlock attached to it。
 The ad pointed out that， yes， it is the insurance companies that pay for stolen goods， but who is going to pay for what the new atmosphere of distrust and fear is doing to our way of life？ Who is going to make the psychic payment for the transformation of America from the Land of the Free to the Land of the Lock？
 For that is what has happened。 We have become so used to defending ourselves against the new atmosphere of American life， so used to putting up barriers， that we have not had time to think about what it may mean。
 And it has taken over。 If you work for a medium- to large-size company， chances are that you don't just wander in and out of work。 You probably carry some kind of access card， electronic or otherwise， that allows you in and out of your place of work。 Maybe the security guard at the front desk knows your face and will wave you in most days， but the fact remains that the business you work for feels threatened enough to keep outsiders away via these "keys。"
 There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream;go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,enough sorrow to keep you human,enough hope to make you happy? Always put yourself in others’shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably hurts the other person, too.The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have tried,for only they can appreciate the importance of people
who have touched their lives.Love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can’t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your past failures and heartaches.
When you were born,you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.Live your life so that when you die,you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.
Please send this message to those people who mean something to you,to those who have touched your life in one way or another,to those who make you smile when you really need it,to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down,to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.And if you don’t, don’t worry,nothing bad will happen to you,you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone’s day with this message.

Nowadays, more and more middle-aged people are suffering from insomnia, as life for the middle-aged is stressful indeed. For one thing, as they are the backbones of their companies, they have plenty of things to do at work. And they usually have to work overtime. For another, they have to take great responsibilities at home, for their aged parents need to be supported and their little children need to be brought up. That's why they don't have enough time to have a good rest.To sleep well, some of them often take sleeping pills. I don't think it's good for them to do so, because the sleeping pills can only get rid of the sign of insomnia, not the cause. And taking too much sleeping pills is bad for their health.
Therefore, I suggest those middle-aged people should know how to relax themselves and rest their brains. Taking a simple work after supper will be beneficial for them. Besides, they can have a glass of milk before going to bed, which can be helpful for their sleep.
As we all realized that every one of us will fail during our life. Take me for an example, I fail in my exam. In fact, failure always does appear, which also means that failure is a daily occurrence, however, when facing the failure, different people have different attitudes.
Some people hold the view that failure is the meaning whenever they could not be successful. Thus, if meeting with failure, they will feel so nervous that they have no idea what they are supposed to do. As time goes by, they become more and more dispirited while eventually, they could do nothing well.
On the contrary, there are some people tending to believe another idea. From their point of view, failure is outstanding due to the fact that it can give them plenty of encouragement. Therefore, if facing failure, they will be quite courageous and then try their best to beat it, finally, they make their dream come true.
From my perspective, failure is neither an excellent thing nor an appreciating thing. Sometimes, it is capable to offer us with encouragement, however, it can also make us unconfident now and then. Thus, if encountering the failure, never could we be scared. What we should do is to face it bravely and never give up.
As Xiamen is in the southeast of China and close to the sea, it's neither too cold in winter nor too hot in summer. It's warm and humid all the year round. But the best seasons to go to Xiamen are both spring and summer. In spring, it never winds so hard, so we can take a walk along the sea and breathe fresh air. As for summer, it's the best season for entertainment. We can go swimming in the sea and feel the soft sea wind on the beach. Perhaps we can find endless pleasure.
Besides, there are some famous tourist sites in Xiamen. And the most beautiful scenic spot is Gulangyu Island. We can visit foreign architectures, nice gardens, beautiful parks, and traditional museums there. Once we are in Xiamen, we can't miss going to Gulangyu Island, or we won't have a good time.
However, in recent years, Xiamen has become a lot more modern than it used to be. Nowadays, more and more skyscrapers and shopping malls have been built, which make Xiamen a wonderful city for sightseeing and shopping. So I eagerly wish to spend my summer holiday there next time.
Next year if I have enough time and money, I plan to have a nice sightseeing tour in Xiamen with my close friends. I hope we can spend the happiest time together there.
Nowadays, people have mobile phones, so the greetings are exchanged by sending messages. Almost all people send the same messages. Maybe time and feet are saved, but the atmosphere of Spring Festival seems to have gone away. What a great loss to our nation.
As far as I'm concerned, I prefer the traditional way of exchanging our greetings. No matter how quick and convenient the modern devices are, they can never substitute the traditional way, as nothing can replace human kindness.
In the past, people used to get up early and go out to visit their relatives on the first morning of Spring Festival. They said “Happy New Year" to the people they met on the street, no matter they knew each other or not. What a merry atmosphere.
Spring Festival is our major festival. It's the festival that only belongs to our Chinese. During Spring Festival, it has been a tradition that we usually exchange our New Year's greeting to each other.
But, why is it so popular currently? As we all know, absorbing online is very convenient and time-saving. We can accurately find the information we want, instead of seeking from a pile of books. We can also learn online any time we want. And we can be free from heavy books. Additionally, we can communicate and share our ideas with others easily when we have questions. What's more, we can get good learning materials in the first place and choose the best one.
In my opinion, learning online will be human’s main learning method in no distant future. But we must be mindful of how to use it correctly.
With the development of network, the Internet has become an essential tool for not only entertainment, but also study. So, online learning has been an appealing topic.
It's so convenient and interesting to join a tourist group. When you travel with a tourist group, you don’t need to book plane and train tickets, and you don't have to care about where to live and what to eat either, because the travel agency will arrange everything for you. All you need to do is to follow the tour guides. They will take you to all the places of interest. They will tell you stories about the interesting places and help you to learn local culture. This is called a package tour.
A cruise trip is so comfortable and relaxing. You travel on a large sea cruiser and enjoy the beautiful scenery. When you come up to a nice place, you can get off the cruiser and visit there. When you are on board, you can lie on the deck, watching the blue sky, the white cloud and the bright sun, and you will be free from stress. Besides, there are so many nice activities on the cruise. For example, you can watch movies; you can see concerts; you can go swimming in the swimming pool; you can play cards; you can play golf; you can watch wonderful performances; and you can also attend dancing parties. Nothing could be more wonderful and relaxing.
Nowadays, backpacking tour has become so popular. It's not just a low-cost travel for budget travelers, but also a nice entertainment. When you have a backpacking tour, you can use public transportations like buses and subways and stay in hostels instead of big hotels, which can save you a lot of money. Today, this kind of travel is especially popular with young people, because they can discover the interesting places and know more about the local cultures by themselves. It's so exciting.
If you want to have a better understanding of a place, you can have a slow travel. When you have a slow travel, you had better spend at least one week living in one place, stay with a local family and visit interesting sites near your living instead of rushing around for a long day to see the must-sees. In this way, you can make more local friends, taste local food, and know the local traditions and customs deeper. Only so can you become more knowledgeable and widen your experience.
We can do anything we are interested in during week-long holidays. For example, we can have a good rest at home; we can get up late in the morning; we can watch interesting TV programs; we can listen to some music we are fond of; we can surf online all day long; we can visit our relatives and friends whom we haven't seen for a long time; we can accompany with our parents at home; we can invite our friends to have a get-together; we can travel to some beautiful places that we always dream of; and we can also learn something we like the most without any disturbance. In a word, week-long holidays are the time for us to entertain ourselves. So how I hope we have week-long holidays every month!
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, made the remarks during an inspection tour in the region.

During the three-day tour that started Monday, he visited villages relocated for poverty relief, pasturing areas, industrial parks and religious venues in Xigaze and Lhasa, and presided over a symposium where he listened to suggestions from the attendees.

Speaking highly of the efforts made by the region's Party committee in recent years, Wang noted that the work related to ethnic and religious affairs concerns the enduring peace and stability of the region, asking for further research into the history of the community of the Chinese nation to improve public awareness of ethnic unity and progress.

He called for raising the social awareness of religious believers that they are, above all, citizens of the country, as well as the promotion of patriotism to further adapt Tibetan Buddhism to the socialist society.

Highlighting a people-centered development vision, Wang stressed that poverty alleviation is both an economic and a political task, and urged efforts to make sure nobody from any ethnic group in Tibet lags behind in marching into a moderately prosperous society.

He also underscored the role of the rural vitalization strategy, education and characteristic industries in poverty alleviation in the region.
World Health Organization (WHO) will send experts to Beijing to exchange ideas with Chinese scientists and medical experts on science-based cooperation to trace the origin of the COVID-19 virus, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Wednesday.

Noting that WHO experts will be traveling to China to prepare scientific plans for identifying the zoonotic source of the disease, Zhao told a daily press briefing that experts from both sides will develop the scope and Terms of Reference for a WHO-led international mission.

"Virus source tracing is a scientific issue that should be studied by scientists through international research and cooperation across the globe," Zhao said, adding that it is also the view of WHO that it is an ongoing process probably concerning many countries and localities, and WHO will conduct similar trips to other countries and regions in light of the actual need.

Zhao said that the WHO and China have maintained communication and cooperation since the start of the pandemic.

Identifying the origin of emerging viral disease has proven complex in past epidemics in different countries. A well planned series of scientific researches will advance the understanding of animal reservoirs and the route of transmission to humans. The process is an evolving endeavor which may lead to further international scientific research and collaboration globally, Zhao said.LHASA, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China's top political advisor Wang Yang has stressed continuous efforts to consolidate the foundations of enduring peace and stability in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.

The efforts should center on safeguarding the country's unity and strengthening ethnic solidarity, resolutely combating separatism, forestalling and defusing major risks and challenges and continuously consolidate the foundations of long-term peace and stability in Tibet.

Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, made the remarks during an inspection tour in the region.
